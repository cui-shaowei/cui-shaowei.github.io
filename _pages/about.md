 I am now working in The State Key Laboratory of Multimodal Artifical Intelligence System (多模态人工智能系统全国重点实验室，MAIS), Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (中科院自动化所，CASIA) as an  Research Assistant. Prior to that, I received my Ph.D degree in CASIA under the supervision of Prof. Shuo Wang.

My research interests include **tactile sensing**, **visual-tactile perception**, and **dexterous robotics manipulation**.
