 I graduated with a bachelor's degree from the School of Mechanical and Automotive Engineering at **South China University of Technology** in 2017. Subsequently, I was recommended for graduate studies and pursued my Ph.D. at the Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences. After obtaining my Ph.D. degree in 2022, I am now working in The State Key Laboratory of Multimodal Artifical Intelligence System, **Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CASIA)** as an **Research Assistant Professor**.

My research interests include **Visuotactile Sensors**, **Visual-Tactile-Language-Action Model**, and **Dexterous Manipulation**.
